# .NET Core Console application letting users sign-in with Username/password to call Microsoft Graph API

[![Build status](https://identitydivision.visualstudio.com/IDDP/_apis/build/status/AAD%20Samples/.NET%20client%20samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-console-up-v2-CI)](https://identitydivision.visualstudio.com/IDDP/_build/latest?definitionId=693)

## About this sample

### Overview

This sample demonstrates how to use MSAL.NET to:

- authenticate the user silently using username and password. [Resource owner password credentials](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.3)
- and call to a web API (in this case, the [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com))

If you would like to get started immediately, skip this section and jump to *How To Run The Sample*.

### Scenario

The application obtains token through username and password, and then calls the Microsoft Graph to get information about the signed-in user and their manager.

Note that Username/Password is needed in some cases (for instance devops scenarios) but it's not recommanded because:

- This requires having credentials in the application, which does not happen with the other flows.
- The credentials should only be used when there is a high degree of trust between the resource owner and the client and when other authorization grant types are not
   available (such as an authorization code).
- Do note that this attempts to authenticate and obtain tokens for users using this flow will often fail with applications registered with Azure AD. Some of the situations and scenarios that will cause the failure are listed below  
  - When the user needs to consent to permissions that this application is requesting. 
  - When a conditional access policy enforcing multi-factor authentication is in force.
  - Azure AD Identity Protection can block authentication attempts if this user account is compromised.
  - The user's pasword is expired and requires a reset.

while this flow seems simpler than the others, applications using these flows often encounter more problems as compared to other flows like authorization code grant. The error handling is also quiet complex (detailed in the sample)

The modern authentication protocols (SAML, WS-Fed, OAuth and OpenID), in principal, discourages apps from handling user credentials themselves. The aim is to decouple the authentication method from an app. Azure AD controls the login experience to avoid exposing secrets (like passwords) to a website or an app.

This enables IdPs like Azure AD to provide seamless single sign-on experiences, enable users to authenticate using factors other than passwords (phone, face, biometrics) and Azure AD can block or elevate authentication attempts if it discerns that the userâ€™s account is compromised or the user is trying to access an app from an untrusted location and such.

## About the code

The code for handling the token acquisition process is simple, as it boils down to calling the `AcquireTokenByUsernamePasswordAsync` method of `PublicClientApplication` class. See the `GetTokenForWebApiUsingUsernamePasswordAsync` method in `PublicAppUsingUsernamePassword.cs`.

```CSharp
private async Task<AuthenticationResult> GetTokenForWebApiUsingUsernamePasswordAsync(IEnumerable<string> scopes, string username, SecureString password)
{
 AuthenticationResult result = null;
 try
 {
  result = await App.AcquireTokenByUsernamePasswordAsync(scopes, username, password);
 }
 catch (MsalUiRequiredException ex) when (ex.Message.Contains("AADSTS65001"))
 {
   ...
   // error handling omited here (see sample for details)
 }
```

## How to run this sample

To run this sample, you'll need:

- [Visual Studio 2017](https://aka.ms/vsdownload) or just the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started)
- An Internet connection
- A Windows machine (necessary if you want to run the app on Windows)
- An OS X machine (necessary if you want to run the app on Mac)
- A Linux machine (necessary if you want to run the app on Linux)
- An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. For more information on how to get an Azure AD tenant, see [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/)
- A user account in your Azure AD tenant. This sample will not work with a Microsoft account (formerly Windows Live account). Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a Microsoft account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.

### Step 1: Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-console-up-v2.git`
```

or download and exact the repository .zip file.

> Given that the name of the sample is pretty long, and so are the name of the referenced NuGet pacakges, you might want to clone it in a folder close to the root of your hard drive, to avoid file size limitations on Windows.

### Step 2: Run the sample

Open the solution in Visual Studio, restore the NuGet packages, select the project, and start it in the debugger.

#### Operating the sample

When you run the sample, if you are running on a domain joined or AAD joined Windows machine, it will display your information as well as the information about your manager.

### Optional: configure the sample as an app in your directory tenant

The instructions so far used the sample is for an app in a Microsoft test tenant: given that the app is multi-tenant, anybody can run the sample against this app entry.
To register your project in your own Azure AD tenant, follow the instructions to manually register the app in your own tenant, so that you can exercise complete control on the app settings and behavior.

#### First step: choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. On the top bar, click on your account, and then on **Switch Directory**.
1. Once the *Directory + subscription* pane opens, choose the Active Directory tenant where you wish to register your application, from the *Favorites* or *All Directories* list.
1. Click on **All services** in the left-hand nav, and choose **Azure Active Directory**.

> In the next steps, you might need the tenant name (or directory name) or the tenant ID (or directory ID). These are presented in the **Properties**
of the Azure Active Directory window respectively as *Name* and *Directory ID*

#### Register the client app (up-console)

1. In **App registrations (Preview)** page, select **New registration**.
1. When the **Register an application page** appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `up-console`.
   - In the **Supported account types** section, select **Accounts in any organizational directory**.
   - Select **Register** to create the application.
1. On the app **Overview** page, find the **Application (client) ID** value and record it for later. You'll need it to configure the Visual Studio configuration file for this project.
1. In the list of pages for the app, select **Manifest**, and:
   - In the manifest editor, set the ``allowPublicClient`` property to **true**
   - Select **Save** in the bar above the manifest editor.
1. In the list of pages for the app, select **API permissions**
   - Click the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected
   - In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, click on **Microsoft Graph**
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, ensure that the right permissions are checked: **User.Read**, **User.ReadBasic.All**. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Select the **Add permissions** button

1. At this stage permissions are assigned correctly but this client app is not capable of user interaction to provide consent to the permissions this app requires.
   To overcome this limitation click the **Grant/revoke admin consent for {tenant}** button, and then select **Yes** when you are asked if you want to grant consent for the
   requested permissions for all account in the tenant.
   You need to be an Azure AD tenant admin to do this.

#### Configure the sample to use your Azure AD tenant

In the steps below, ClientID is the same as Application ID or AppId.

Open the solution in Visual Studio to configure the projects

#### Configure the client project

1. Open the `up-console\appsettings.json` file
1. Find the line where `clientId` is set and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `active-directory-dotnet-up` application copied from the Azure portal.
1. (Optionally) Find the line where `Tenant` is set and replace the existing value with your tenant ID.
